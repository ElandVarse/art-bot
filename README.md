# art-bot

The bot is set to search only in pt-br language. Every 10 sec, it'll retweet the last tweet that contains '#art' in it. I don't think this is the best way to run it, of course you can change the timing in the files.

## Installation 

```sh
  1 - npm install;

  2 - To change the language, just alter 'pt-br' for 'whateverYouWant' in bot.js lang,
  or simply delete the line; 

  3 - To make it work it's necessary that you create a .env inside the doc
  with the keys you get in the APP Twitter;
  
  4 - npm start
  
  ```
